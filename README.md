## Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to cover setting-up a development environment with which you can build your Lancelot games. 

## Get Lancelot

Lancelot 0.13.1 is current version and was released on 20th November 2021.

Lancelot is on [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/dondejvo/lancelot) CDN. Include one of following before all other scripts in your html:

``` html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/DonDejvo/Lancelot@0.13.1/dist/lancelot-cdn-nomodule.js"></script>
```

Github provides the option to download the whole repository as a zip or tar file. However we would strongly recommend you learn to use git instead. It will allow you to easily update to the latest versions of Phaser as they are released.
