### Important Note
This framework is in **very early experimental state** and therefore not published anywhere.
If you want to test it yourself, copy and paste the following script into your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag:

```javascript
<script src="https://raw.githack.com/rayburstjs/RayBurst/master/build/rayburst-cdn-bundle.min.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>
```

### To-Do List 
...till we can go into alpha stage and publish the first package to npm:
- [ ] Add a system that saves vertices in the cache and uses them in a single, main render loop
- [ ] Add more geometric shapes and other rendering options
- [ ] More customizable canvas setup
- [ ] Improved custom syntax, 2d animations
- [ ] Basic Runtime

**Once this list is finished, the fun can begin!**
